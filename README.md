Welcome to Easel!

This App is meant to be a source of ideas for artists. It is an app where a user can upload pictures they find on the internet and share them with other users. Posts are joined with a caption if the user chooses to add one to their post.

--Home--
Once you visit the application, you will see the Home page. This is where you can see all the posts that were submitted by other users. You will notice each post is accompanied with a User that it was uploaded by. You will also notice the message under each post 'Please Log in to Like/Comment!'. You will be greeted with the same message if you click the Upload tab while not logged in. Comments on a post can only be deleted by the EaselTeam Moderator and the User who created the post

--Log in--
In order to access the full functionality of Easel, make your way to the Login tab if you already have an account. If you do not have an account yet, be sure to click on the Create Profile tab to get started. The Login tab is self explanatory. Simply input your log in credentials. If correct, you will get a message 'You are Logged in, User' and you will see in the top right of the application, a Welcome Back message. If the log in credentials are not correct you will see an error message and will not be able to move further.
